# Density-field plotter
Density-field plotter plot the density and laser field in the same picture.
The field includes the laser electric field in the laser polarization direction and longitudinal electric field along the simulation box.

To run, `python rho_electric.py`. To generate the corresponding `jupyter notebook`, we use
[`jupytext`](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext). 

To generate a jupyter notebook from a Python script, do:

```console
jupytext rho_electric.py --to ipynb
```

One then has to delete the original Python script, which will be re-generated by Jupyter.

For `LaTeX` font rendering of `matplotlib` figures, under `Ubuntu 20.04`:

```console
$ sudo apt install dvipng texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended cm-super
```
